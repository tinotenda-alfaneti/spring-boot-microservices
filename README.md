# Spring Boot Microservices - Online Store Project

I am going to be building the microservices using Spring Cloud.
Spring Cloud is A lightweight event-driven microservices framework to quickly build applications that can connect to external systems.

The Services I am looking forward to build in this project are:-

1. Product Service - Create and View Products, acts as Product Catalog
2. Order Service - Can Order Products
3. Inventory Service - Can check if the product is in stock or not.
4. Notification Service - Can send a notification after order is placed
